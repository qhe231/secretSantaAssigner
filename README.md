# secretSantaAssigner

## Build, run and test instructions:
I built this application as a console app where the manager can interact with the console to do waht he/she needs.
You just need to run the code and follow the prompt to use it.

## Test instructions:
I used JUnit test to test the functionality of Staff Manager and Secret Santa Assigner to ensure that they can perform their functions properly.

## Design decisions and trade-offs:
Since I have not learned how to build APIs with Java and any related frameworks. At the moment, I can only build this console application.
However, if it is required, I can learn how to build APIs with Java and related frameworks before the commence of the internship.

## If I only had more time: 
I will check the format of emails and names.
I will learn how to build APIs with Java and do the out of scope part.
